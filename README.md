# Routegadget 2

## Latest news
Version 1.4.8 was released on 11th February 2018 and is installed on all routegadget.co.uk sites.

This is a minor release with two new features:
* When selecting runners for replay you can now select only those who have drawn or uploaded a route. Select the "Routes" checkbox rather than the "All" checkbox on the results tab. Thanks to Robin Strain for finally prompting me to add something I had kept thinking would be a good idea.
* An option has been added to the RG2 manager to sort the results file, which is done by course, then position, then time and finally name. The majority of users will not need to select this option, since their results file will already be in a sensible order. Thanks to Mikko K from Finland for the original pull request.

## What is RouteGadget?
Routegadget is a Web application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. The original version was developed by Jarkko Ryypp√∂, and it is now used by orienteering clubs around the world.

## Why Routegadget 2?
The original Routegadget makes extensive use of Java, and this has caused increasing difficulties.
Routegadget 2 allows you to view existing Routegadget information in any modern (HTML5-compliant) browser without the need for Java. It also adds a modern user interface as well as updated functionality for analysis.

## What is RouteGadget?
Routegadget is a Web application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. The original version was developed by Jarkko Ryypp√∂, and it is now used by orienteering clubs around the world.

## Why Routegadget 2?
The original Routegadget makes extensive use of Java, and this has caused increasing difficulties.
Routegadget 2 allows you to view existing Routegadget information in any modern (HTML5-compliant) browser without the need for Java. It also adds a modern user interface as well as updated functionality for analysis.

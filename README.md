# Routegadget 2

## Latest news
Version 1.4.5 was released on 13th September 2017 and is installed on all routegadget.co.uk sites.

This is a minor release. The display of positions in the results tab has been tidied up. It also corrects a bug associated with drawing routes for events that have courses but no splits, which wasn't something I knew you could do in the first place.

## What is RouteGadget?
Routegadget is a Web application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. The original version was developed by Jarkko Ryypp√∂, and it is now used by orienteering clubs around the world.

## Why Routegadget 2?
The original Routegadget makes extensive use of Java, and this has caused increasing difficulties.
Routegadget 2 allows you to view existing Routegadget information in any modern (HTML5-compliant) browser without the need for Java. It also adds a modern user interface as well as updated functionality for analysis.

# Routegadget 2

## Latest news
Version 1.4.0 was released on 22nd April 2017.

It includes various minor enhancements, including the facility to search the events and results lists.

[Guidance on creating map files](https://github.com/Maprunner/rg2/wiki/Map-files) has also been added.

I would recommend using the RG2 manager to set up events rather than the original Routegadget Java version. This will give you some extra functionality (such as positions in the results), and it is also a lot easier to get the controls aligned.

## What is RouteGadget?
Routegadget is a Web application for drawing and comparing orienteering routes. The original version was developed by Jarkko Ryypp√∂, and it is now used by orienteering clubs around the world.

## Why Routegadget 2?
The original Routegadget makes extensive use of Java, and this has caused increasing difficulties.
Routegadget 2 allows you to view existing Routegadget information in any modern (HTML5-compliant) browser without the need for Java. It also adds a modern user interface as well as updated functionality for analysis.
